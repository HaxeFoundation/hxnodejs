/**
	A Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is available both as a standalone program and easily includable in other programs.
	The REPL provides a way to interactively run JavaScript and see the results.
	It can be used for debugging, testing, or just trying things out.

	By executing node without any arguments from the command-line you will be dropped into the REPL.
	It has simplistic emacs line-editing.
