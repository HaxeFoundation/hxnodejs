		`Socket` has the property that `socket.write` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly.

		wire when it is possible. (Internally it is polling on the socket's file descriptor for being writable).

		The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. This property shows the number of characters
		currently buffered to be written. (Number of characters is approximately equal to the number of bytes to be written,
		but the buffer may contain strings, and the strings are lazily encoded, so the exact number of bytes is not known.)
