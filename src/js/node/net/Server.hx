		A `port` value of zero will assign a random port.

		`backlog` is the maximum length of the queue of pending connections. The actual length will be determined
		by your OS through sysctl settings such as tcp_max_syn_backlog and somaxconn on linux.
		The default value of this parameter is 511 (not 512).

		When `path` is provided, start a local socket server listening for connections on the given path.

		When `handle` is provided, it should be either a server or socket (anything with an underlying `_handle` member),
		or a {fd: <n>} object. This will cause the server to accept connections on the specified handle,
		but it is presumed that the file descriptor or handle has already been bound to a port or domain socket.
		Listening on a file descriptor is not supported on Windows.

		This function is asynchronous. When the server has been bound, 'listening' event will be emitted.
		The last parameter `callback` will be added as an listener for the 'listening' event.
