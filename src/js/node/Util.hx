		Takes an async function (or a function that returns a `Promise`) and returns a function following

		In the callback, the first argument will be the rejection reason (or `null` if the `Promise` resolved),
		and the second argument will be the resolved value.

		The callback is executed asynchronously, and will have a limited stack trace. If the callback throws,
		the process will emit an 'uncaughtException' event, and if not handled will exit.

		Since `null` has a special meaning as the first argument to a callback, if a wrapped function rejects
		a `Promise` with a falsy value as a reason, the value is wrapped in an `Error` with the original value

		The `format()` method returns a formatted string using the first argument as a printf-like format.

		The first argument is a string that contains zero or more placeholders.
		Each placeholder is replaced with the converted value from its corresponding argument.
		Supported placeholders are:
			%s - String.
			%d - Number (both integer and float) or BigInt.
			%i - Integer or BigInt.
			%f - Floating point value.
			%j - JSON. Replaced with the string '[Circular]' if the argument contains circular references.
			%o - Object. A string representation of an object with generic JavaScript object formatting. Similar to util.inspect()
			with options { showHidden: true, showProxy: true }. This will show the full object including non-enumerable properties
			and proxies.
			%O - Object. A string representation of an object with generic JavaScript object formatting. Similar to util.inspect()
			without options. This will show the full object not including non-enumerable properties and proxies.
			%% - single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument.
		If the placeholder does not have a corresponding argument, the placeholder is not replaced.

		If there are more arguments passed to the `format()` method than the number of placeholders, the extra arguments are
		coerced into strings then concatenated to the returned string, each delimited by a space. Excessive arguments whose `typeof`
		is 'object' or 'symbol' (except null) will be transformed by `inspect()`.
		
		If the first argument is not a string then `format()` returns a string that is the concatenation of all arguments separated
		by spaces. Each argument is converted to a string using `inspect()`.

		If only one argument is passed to `format()`, it is returned as it is without any formatting.

		in the recursive inspection, as well as the options object passed to `inspect()`.

		Using the `showHidden` option allows to inspect WeakMap and WeakSet entries.
		If there are more entries than `maxArrayLength`, there is no guarantee which entries are displayed.
		That means retrieving the same WeakSet entries twice might actually result in a different output.
		Besides this any item might be collected at any point of time by the garbage collectorif there is no strong reference
