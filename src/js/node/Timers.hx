	The `timer` module exposes a global API for scheduling functions to be called at some future period of time.
	Because the timer functions are globals, there is no need to call `require('timers')` to use the API.

	The timer functions within Node.js implement a similar API as the timers API provided by Web Browsers
	but use a different internal implementation that is built around the Node.js Event Loop.
