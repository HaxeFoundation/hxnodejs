			Sending an 'Expect' header will immediately send the request headers.
			Usually, when sending 'Expect: 100-continue', you should both set a timeout
			and listen for the continue event. See RFC2616 Section 8.2.3 for more information.

/**
	The HTTP interfaces in Node are designed to support many features of the protocol
	which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages.
	The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses--the user is able to stream data.

	HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:
		{ 'content-length': '123',
		  'content-type': 'text/plain',
		  'connection': 'keep-alive' }
	Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified.

	In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, Node's HTTP API is very low-level.
	It deals with stream handling and message parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but
	it does not parse the actual headers or the body.
