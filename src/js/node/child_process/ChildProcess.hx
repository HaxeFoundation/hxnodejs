		a message on its channel.

		Please note that the `send` method on both the parent and child are synchronous - sending large chunks of data is
		not advised (pipes can be used instead, see `spawn`).

		There is a special case when sending a {cmd: 'NODE_foo'} `message`. All messages containing a `NODE_` prefix in
		its cmd property will not be emitted in the 'message' event, since they are internal messages used by node core.
		Messages containing the prefix are emitted in the 'internalMessage' event, you should by all means avoid using
		this feature, it is subject to change without notice.

		The `sendHandle` option is for sending a TCP server or socket object to another process.
		The child will receive the object as its second argument to the message event.

		The `callback` option is a function that is invoked after the message is sent but before the target may have received it.
		It is called with a single argument: null on success, or an `Error` object on failure.

		Emits an 'error' event if the message cannot be sent, for example because the child process has already exited.

		Returns true under normal circumstances or false when the backlog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that
		makes it unwise to send more. Use the callback mechanism to implement flow control.
