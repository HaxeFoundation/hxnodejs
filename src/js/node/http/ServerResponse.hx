		The status code is a 3-digit HTTP status code, like `404`. The last argument, `headers`, are the response headers.

		This method must only be called once on a message and it must be called before `end()` is called.

		If `write()` or `end()` are called before calling this, the implicit/mutable headers will be calculated and call this function.

		When headers have been set with `setHeader()`, they will be merged with any headers passed to `writeHead()`, with the headers passed to `writeHead()` given precedence.

		If this method is called and `setHeader()` has not been called, it will directly write the supplied header values onto the network channel without caching internally,
		and the `getHeader()` on the header will not yield the expected result.
		If progressive population of headers is desired with potential future retrieval and modification, use `setHeader()` instead.

		`Content-Length` is given in bytes not characters.
		The above example works because the string `'hello world'` contains only single byte characters.
		If the body contains higher coded characters then `Buffer.byteLength()` should be used to determine the number of bytes in a given encoding.
		And Node.js does not check whether `Content-Length` and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal or not.

		Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters will result in a `TypeError` being thrown.
