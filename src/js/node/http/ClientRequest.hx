/**
	This object is created internally and returned from http.request().
	It represents an in-progress request whose header has already been queued.
	The header is still mutable using the `setHeader(name, value)`, `getHeader(name)`, `removeHeader(name)` API.
	The actual header will be sent along with the first data chunk or when calling `request.end()`.

	To get the response, add a listener for `'response'` to the request object.
	`'response'` will be emitted from the request object when the response headers have been received.
	The `'response'` event is executed with one argument which is an instance of `http.IncomingMessage`.

	During the `'response'` event, one can add listeners to the response object; particularly to listen for the `'data'` event.

	If no `'response'` handler is added, then the response will be entirely discarded. However,
	if a `'response'` event handler is added, then the data from the response object *must* be consumed,
	either by calling `response.read()` whenever there is a `'readable'` event, or by adding a `'data'` handler,
	or by calling the `.resume()` method. Until the data is consumed, the `'end'` event will not fire.
	Also, until the data is read it will consume memory that can eventually lead to a 'process out of memory' error.

	Unlike the `request` object, if the response closes prematurely, the response object does not emit an `'error'` event
	but instead emits the `'aborted'` event.

	Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal or not.
