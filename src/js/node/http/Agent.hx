/**
	An `Agent` is responsible for managing connection persistence and reuse for HTTP clients.
	It maintains a queue of pending requests for a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each until the queue is empty,
	at which time the socket is either destroyed or put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the same host and port.
	Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the `keepAlive` option.

	Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may still close idle connections, in which case they will be removed
	from the pool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for that host and port.
	Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests over the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be remade for every
	request and cannot be pooled.
	The `Agent` will still make the requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.

	When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed from the pool.
	Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not to keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.
	(see [socket.unref()](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_unref)).

	It is good practice, to `destroy()` an Agent instance when it is no longer in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.

	Sockets are removed from an agent when the socket emits either a `'close'` event or an `'agentRemove'` event.
	When intending to keep one HTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the agent, something like the following may be done.

	An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing `{agent: false}` as an option to the `http.get()` or `http.request()` functions,
	a one-time use `Agent` with default options will be used for the client connection.
