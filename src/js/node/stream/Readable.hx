	The Readable stream interface is the abstraction for a source of data that you are reading from.
	In other words, data comes out of a Readable stream.

	A Readable stream will not start emitting data until you indicate that you are ready to receive it.

	Readable streams have two "modes": a flowing mode and a non-flowing mode.
	When in flowing mode, data is read from the underlying system and provided to your program as fast as possible.
	In non-flowing mode, you must explicitly call `read` to get chunks of data out.

	Examples of readable streams include:
		- http responses, on the client
		- http requests, on the server
		- fs read streams
		- zlib streams
		- crypto streams
		- tcp sockets
		- child process stdout and stderr
		- process.stdin
