	The `stream.PassThrough` class is a trivial implementation of a `Transform` stream
	that simply passes the input bytes across to the output.
	Its purpose is primarily for examples and testing, but there are some use cases
	where `stream.PassThrough` is useful as a building block for novel sorts of streams.
